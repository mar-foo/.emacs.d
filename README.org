* My Emacs configuration
  [[./splash.png]]

My configuration organized in thematically organized modules loaded in
[[./mf-lisp/mf-config.el][mf-config.el]].

** Features
- Very quick load time due to lazy loading of packages
- No use package, autoloads are setup manually and packages are
  installed with built-in *package.el* functions
- Custom monochrome themes *mf*, *mf-dark* and *mf-acme* (inspired by
  [[https://acme.cat-v.org][Acme]])
- Custom functions to toggle shell buffers (+ integration with
  [[http://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective.el]])
- A working GTD workflow built around [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] (inspired by
  [[https://github.com/rougier/emacs-gtd][rougier/emacs-gtd]])
- Completion with [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]] and [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]]
- Simple integration between [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/project.html][project.el]] (builtin for Emacs 28+) and
  [[http://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective.el]]
